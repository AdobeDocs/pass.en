# Troubleshoot issues in Account IQ {#troubleshoot}

If you're experiencing delays in loading data and charts, difficulties exporting reports, or any other issues related to metrics or graphs, continue reading for prompt troubleshooting assistance.

* If a page or individual panels take too long to load, then try refreshing the page. For the current release, depending on the current segment, a page can take up to a minute to load.
