# [!UICONTROL Account IQ] overview {#account-iq-overview}

Understanding, identifying, and acting on credential sharing is a complex process. There is complexity involved in understanding the subscriber usage behavior and in developing a holistic view of their activity—for example, distinguishing sharing among members within the same household and outside. Due to this challenging complexity, streaming service providers may have inhibitions in acting against credential sharing.

<div class "preview">
Generally, video streaming service providers are aware of the risk and cost of sharing in theior business that includes churn, poor customer experience, and negative brand impact. However, they have limited solutions available, such as blocking the sharers or providing alternative offers. However, an informed and targeted approach is recommended—one that enables services to understand sharing accurately and to adopt strategies that reward good viewing behavior and simultaneously target business growth. </span>

Adobe Pass [!UICONTROL Account IQ] enables video streaming services to understand the subscriber usage patterns and identify credential sharing. By deeply analyzing each subscriber's activity using Adobe's proprietary multi-layer machine learning model, streaming services can understand usage behavior and identify credential sharing with a greater degree of certainty. Moreover, it enables action to be taken through integrations with other systems such as limiting concurrent streams or customizing offers, and validates the impact of those actions—whether encouraging legitimate viewing behavior or growing subscribers and revenue.

[!UICONTROL Account IQ] provides the tools and features to measure, manage, and monetize credential sharing. Reports, analytics, and dashboards enable exploration of the data to identify patterns. Direct action is supported through exports and integrations with Adobe and third-party systems, such as campaign management, currency limiting or subscriber registration. And dedicated tracking tools measure the success of those actions so they can be updated or expanded.
