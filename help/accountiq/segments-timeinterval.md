# Subscriber segments and time interval {#cohorts-segments}

When you log into Account IQ, the segment panel at the top allows you to specify the subscriber [segment](product-concepts.md#segmet-def). This helps in filtering results when viewing reports on subscriber sharing behavior and patterns. A default segment named-[!UICONTROL ALL ACCOUNTS IN YOUR PROPERTIES] is already selected, and you see the following options in the segment panel:

For programmer or MVPD users, navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Open segment]** option. Choose a segment from the list and click **[!UICONTROL Open segment]** to view the account sharing reports.

Click on <img alt= "expand [!UICONTROL segment summary]" src="./assets/expand-segment-summary.svg" width="25"> icon to view the detailed [!UICONTROL SEGMENT SUMMARY]. It also presents information on the number of subscriber accounts and their playback requests within the chosen time duration.

The [!UICONTROL SEGMENT SUMMARY] is used to define the following components:

[Programmers](product-concepts.md#programmer-def) [!UICONTROL in segment] are the selected content providers within a segment whose subscriber account sharing reports you intend to access.

[Channels](product-concepts.md#channel-def) [!UICONTROL in segment] indicate the selected channels for observing their account sharing analytics, aligned with the chosen MVPDs in a segment.

[MVPDs](product-concepts.md#mvpd-def) [!UICONTROL in segment] represent the the specific individual or group of selected MVPDs within a segment, for which you aim to access the subscriber account sharing reports.

[Metrics](product-concepts.md#metric) [!UICONTROL in segment] refer to the chosen attributes or criteria for a segment to access a subscriber's account sharing report.

## [!UICONTROL GRANULARITY AND TIME INTERVAL] {#granularity-timeinterval}

  The [!UICONTROL GRANULARITY AND TIME INTERVAL] selector lets you specify the dates and duration aggregated on a weekly/monthly basis for observing subscriber sharing behavior. The default selection is the current week and you can modify the duration using the options shown in the image.
