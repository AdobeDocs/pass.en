# Subscriber segments and time interval {#cohorts-segments}

When you log into Account IQ, the segment launcher panel at the top allows you to specify the subscriber [segment](/help/accountiq/product-concepts.md#segment-segmet-def). This helps in filtering results when viewing reports on subscriber sharing behavior and patterns. A default segment named-All accounts in your properties is already selected, and you see the following options in the segment launcher:

For programmer or MVPD users, navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Open segment]** option. Choose a segment from the list and select **[!UICONTROL Open segment]** to view the account sharing reports.

Use the **Eye** icon to view the detailed **[!UICONTROL Segment Summary]**. It presents information on the number of subscriber accounts and their playback requests within the chosen time interval.

The **[!UICONTROL Segment Summary]** is used to define the following components:

**[!UICONTROL [Programmers](/help/accountiq/product-concepts.md#Programmers-programmer-def) in segment]**  are the selected content providers within a segment whose subscriber account sharing reports you intend to access.

**[!UICONTROL [Channels](/help/accountiq/product-concepts.md#Channels-channel-def) in segment]** indicate the selected channels for observing their account sharing analytics, aligned with the chosen MVPDs in a segment.

**[!UICONTROL [MVPDs](/help/accountiq/product-concepts.md#MVPDs-mvpd-def) in segment]** represent the the specific individual or group of selected MVPDs within a segment, for which you aim to access the subscriber account sharing reports.

**[!UICONTROL [Metrics](/help/accountiq/product-concepts.md#Metrics-metric) in segment]** refer to the chosen attributes or criteria for a segment to access a subscriber's account sharing report.

## [!UICONTROL Granularity and time interval] {#granularity-timeinterval}

  The **[!UICONTROL Granularity and time interval]** selector lets you specify the dates and duration aggregated on a weekly/monthly basis for observing subscriber sharing behavior. The default selection is the current week and you can modify the duration using the options shown in the image.
