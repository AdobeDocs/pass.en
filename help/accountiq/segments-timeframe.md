# Subscriber segments and time interval {#cohorts-segments}

When you log into Account IQ, the segment launcher panel at the top allows you to specify the subscriber [segment](/help/accountiq/product-concepts.md#segment-segmet-def). This helps in filtering results when viewing reports on subscriber sharing behavior and patterns. A default segment named-All accounts in your properties is already selected, and you see the following options in the segment launcher:

The segment summary defines the following parameters:

**[!UICONTROL Programmers in segment]**

**[!UICONTROL Channels in segment]**

**[!UICONTROL MVPDs in segment]**

**[!UICONTROL Metrics in segment]**

<!-- The definitions of these parameters will be defined in the glossary? or the parameters are different for a programmer/mvpd?-->

## [!UICONTROL Granularity and time interval] {#granularity-timeinterval}

  The **[!UICONTROL Granularity and time interval]** selector lets you specify the dates and duration aggregated on a weekly/monthly basis for observing subscriber sharing behavior. The default selection is the current week and you can modify the duration using the options shown in the image.

**B** Select left arrow to move backward<br/>
**C** Select right arrow to move forward<br/>
**D** Option to choose Granularity by week/month<br/>

Applying these controls you can define your problem statement as "subscribers of the MVPD A that watched the channels X, Y, and Z in the month of October".
