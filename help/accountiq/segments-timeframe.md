# Subscriber segments and time interval {#cohorts-segments}


When you log into Account IQ, the segment launcher panel at the top allows you to specify the subscriber [segment](/help/accountiq/product-concepts.md#segment-segmet-def). This helps in filtering results when viewing reports on subscriber sharing behavior and patterns. A default segment named-All accounts in your properties is already selected, and you see the following options in the segment launcher:

## Segment selection {#segment-selection}

For programmer or MVPD users, navigate to the **Open segment** option. Choose a segment from the list and select **Open segment** to view the account sharing reports.

Use the **Eye** icon to view the detailed segment summary, presenting the information on the number of subscriber accounts and playback requests by them within the chosen time interval.

The segment summary is used to define the following parameters:

**[!UICONTROL Programmers in segment]**

**[!UICONTROL Channels in segment]**

**[!UICONTROL MVPD in segment]**

**[!UICONTROL Metrics in segment]**

<!-- The definitions of these parameters will be defined in the glossary article-->

## [!UICONTROL Granularity and time interval] {#granularity-timeinterval}
  
  The **[!UICONTROL Granularity and time interval]** selector lets you specify the dates and duration aggregated on a weekly/monthly basis for observing subscriber account sharing behavior. The default selection of the time interval is the current week, but you can modify the duration using the options shown in the image.

**B** Select the left arrow to move backward<br/>
**C** Select the right arrow to move forward<br/>
**D** Select the granularity by week/month<br/>
**E** Selected time interval<br/>

Applying these controls you can define your problem statement as "subscribers of the MVPD A that watched the channels X, Y, and Z in the month of October".
