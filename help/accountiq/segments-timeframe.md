# Subscriber segments and time frame {#cohorts-segments}

When you log into Account IQ, there is a panel at the top that lets you define the subscriber [segment](/help/accountiq/product-concepts.md#segment-segmet-def) to filter your results for viewing reports for subscriber sharing behavior and patterns.

The following dropdown options are used to define segments:

**[!UICONTROL MVPDs in segment]**

The **[!UICONTROL MVPDs in segment]** selector lets you choose the [MVPDs](/help/accountiq/product-concepts.md#mvpd-def) (individuals or group) for whose subscriber you want to view the account sharing reports.

In this selector, apart from selecting the individual MVPDs you can also select the following groups:

*   [Top 10 MVPDs by sharing score](/help/accountiq/product-concepts.md#top-mvpds-def)

*   [Top 10 MVPDs by usage](/help/accountiq/product-concepts.md#top-mvpds-def)

*   [Top 10 MVPDs by accounts](/help/accountiq/product-concepts.md#top-mvpds-def)

*   [Isolation mode](/help/accountiq/isolation-mode.md)

**[!UICONTROL Channels in segment]**

When you are logged in as a programmer user then you can select your channels to view their account sharing analytics. Use the **[!UICONTROL Channels in segment]** dropdown option to select individual or multiple channels in your organization.

*   [Top 10 programmers by sharing score](/help/accountiq/product-concepts.md#top-mvpds-def)

*   [Top 10 programmers by usage](/help/accountiq/product-concepts.md#top-mvpds-def)

*   [Top 10 programmers by accounts](/help/accountiq/product-concepts.md#top-mvpds-def)

  <!--For example, you can define your segment as the "subscribers of the MVPD A that watched the channels X, Y, and Z".-->

  

## [!UICONTROL Granularity and time frame] {#granularity-timeframe}
  
  The **[!UICONTROL Granularity and time frame]** selector lets you specify the dates and the duration, or size of time for which you want to view the subscriber sharing behavior.

  ![[!UICONTROL Granularity and timeframe]](assets/granularity-timeframe-weekwise.png)
  
So, with these controls you can define your problem statement as "subscribers of the MVPD A that watched the channels X, Y, and Z in the month of May".
