# Operations {#operations-tab-next-steps}

Once you have understood your subscribers' usage patterns and identified password sharing for selected segment (using [!DNL Analytics] in Account IQ), you can take targeted actions towards an objective to mitigate password sharing.

The Operations functionality in Account IQ help you effectively tackle and manage credential sharing through focused procedures called operations. It gives you options to design an objective, tailor targeted actions (based on the objective) for a specific groups of subscriber accounts, and automate their execution for a future duration. Through Operations functionality, you can not only create and execute operations, but also gauge their impacts. So, by gauging the impacts you can adjust your strategy to optimize the effect, whether converting borrowers or mitigating credential sharing.

To view **Operations** page select **Operations** option under **Actions** in left navigation of Account IQ application. The Operations page lists all the operations already existing on Account IQ system along with their details.

On the Operations page, you can:

* View a list of operations already existing in Account IQ

* View operation details, such as:

  * status (Scheduled, Running, Ended, Error, or Stopped)

  * progress (in percentage completion)
  
  * target audience (segment to run the operation on)

  * schedule (beginning and end date of operation)

  * creation and end date of the operation

* [Create new operation](/help/accountiq/operation-affecting-user-segment.md)

* [View operation reports](#operation-reports)

<!--* Search from the list of operations using Search field

* Stop an operation.

* Create a duplicate operation.

* [Configure columns of Operations details page](#configure-columns)-->

## View operation reports {#operation-reports}

You can analyze the impacts of an operation by viewing its report. To view an operation's report:

1. Select the operation name on main Operations page.

   The report is displayed in the form of a stacked column graph.

   *Figure: Operations report to view the impacts of the operations*

   X-axis represents the evaluation period and y-axis depicts the impact of the operation (in terms of number of accounts in a segment during evaluation period). Each bar is divided into three parts.

   * One part represents the number of accounts which still meet the operation segment's criteria.

   * Another part represents the number of active accounts for that period which were originally in the segment, but no longer meet the operation segment's criteria.

   * The third part represents the accounts that were not actve in that period.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The First bar represents the number of accounts which meet the operation segment's conditions in the beginning of the evaluation period.

   Over time the graph shows effect of your action (through the operation) by indicating the number of accounts that have changed their behavior relative to the original criteria (for example, having sharing probability more than 90 and using more than 5 devices), or have become inactive.

<!--For example, in the above image the variable on the y-axis is number of accounts. Looking at the graph you can compare the number of accounts that are in the operations' segment versus the number of accounts that are outside the operations segment at a particular time (such as week 2nd of the operations evaluation period). Therefore, you can analyze how over the evaluation period do number of accounts vary within the operation segment and outside the segment.

So, if your operation was to send out warning emails to suspecting accounts, and accounts in operations segment were those with sharing probability more than 90 and using more than 5 devices to stream content, then in the beginning of the evaluation period accounts in segment are more than 17 thousand. This number changes over the evaluation period as shown in the graph, thereby indicating the impact of operation. Based on the evaluation, you can take remedial measures on suspecting accounts, or continue with the operation, or adjust your strategy for better outcomes to curb credential sharing.-->

1. To close the report and go back to the main Operations page, select **Operations** option under **Actions** in left navigation.
