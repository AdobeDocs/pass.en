# Usage Patterns {#usage-patterns}

Account IQ classifies users of subscriber accounts into various categories in terms of their social behavior, such as traveler or commuter, Large family and Community sharing. The **Usage Patterns** page shows several different analytics and reports for these user typologies. For example, **Usage patterns distribution - Users in segment vs Industry** report compares the usage behavior for the current segment versus the entire industry.

Like the other pages in the app, the analytics and reports here are based on the current segment as defined in the [segment panel](/help/accountiq/segments-timeinterval.md).

## Usage patterns distribution {#usage-pattern-dis}

The bar graph in *[!UICONTROL *Usage patterns distribution- Users in segment vs Industry]** depicts number and percentages of subscribers for each social behavior, or usage pattern. In addition to comparing each usage pattern in the current segment to the entire industry, it also compares them to a segment containing all of your channels.

## Usage pattern distribution in segment {#usage-pattern-dis-segment}

The **[!UICONTROL Usage patterns distribution in segment]** panel tabulates the following information for each user pattern:

* Sharing probability range that the individual accounts fall into
* Number and percentage of accounts in that pattern
* Overall and perctage of usage by subscribers in that category in terms of play requests

For example, in the above image:

* A regular user (one to a few people with a limited number of devices in only one location) in the defined segment has the account sharing probability between 5 to 13%.

* And 70.2% (376,615) of the total subscriber accounts (536,640) are regular users.

* And 44.5% (2,896,346) of the total play requests (6,512,593) are made by regular users.
