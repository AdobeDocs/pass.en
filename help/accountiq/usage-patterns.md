# Usage Patterns {#usage-patterns}

Account IQ classifies users of subscriber accounts into various categories in terms of their social behavior, such as traveler or commuter, Large family, and Community sharing. The **Usage Patterns** page shows several different analytics and reports for these user typologies. For example, **Usage patterns distribution** reports compare the usage behavior for the current segment versus all of your accounts.

Like the other pages in the app, the analytics and reports here are based on the current segment defined in the [segment panel](/help/accountiq/segments-timeinterval.md).

## Usage patterns distribution {#usage-pattern-dis}

The cluster bar graph in depicts the number and percentages of subscribers for each social behavior, or usage pattern.

* 70.2% (376,615) of the total subscriber accounts (536,640) are regular users.

* 44.5% (2,896,346) of the total play requests (6,512,593) are made by regular users.
