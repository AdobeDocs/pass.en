# Export data panel reports {#export-reports}

The dashboard in [!UICONTROL Account IQ] displays tables and graphs for analyzing credential sharing statistics of the subscriber accounts in the selected segment. Apart from viewing the sharing patterns, scores, and account usage metrics, you can also export reports from these tables.

You can export the following data panel reports:

* [Video categories in segment](data-panels.md#video-categories-segment) 
* [Number of accounts and usage by sharing probability level](data-panels.md#number-of-accounts-usage-sharing-probability)

Follow the steps to export data panel reports for a specific segment.

1. Log in with your credentials.
1. Select a required segment and time interval from segment and time interval panel. View [segments and time interval](segments-timeinterval.md#segment-selection) for more information.

   If required, refer to the instructions for [creating a segment](work-with-segments.md#create-new-segment) or [editing a segment](work-with-segments.md#edit-segment).

1. Navigate to the data panel you want to export. 

   For example, consider the **Number of accounts and usage by sharing probability level** panel as shown below.

   ![Export Number of accounts and usage by sharing probability level](assets/export-report.png){align="left"}

   *Export Number of accounts and usage by sharing probability level*

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Export]** located in the upper-right corner of the data panel.

The file will automatically download to your local machine. The system saves the data for number of accounts and usage by sharing probability level in a CSV file.

The following is an example of the exported CSV file. The file consists of the columns that appear on the selected data panel.
