# Export data panel reports {#export-reports}

The Dashboard in [!UICONTROL Account IQ] displays tables and graphs for analyzing credential sharing statistics of the subscriber accounts in the selected segment. Apart from viewing the sharing patterns, scores, and account usage metrics, you can also export reports from these tables.

You can export the following data panel reports:

* [Video categories in segment](data-panels.md#video-categories-segment) 
* [Number of accounts and usage by sharing probability level](data-panels.md#number-of-accounts-usage-sharing-probability)

To export data panel reports for a specific segment, follow these steps:

1. Log in with your authorized credentials.
1. Select a required segment and time interval from segment and time interval panel. View [segments and time interval](segments-timeinterval.md#segment-selection) for more information.

   If required, refer to the instructions for [creating a new segment](work-with-segments.md#create-new-segment) or [editing a segment](work-with-segments.md#edit-segment).

1. Navigate to the data panel you want to export. 

   For example, consider the **Number of accounts and usage by sharing probability level** panel as shown below.

   ![Export Number of accounts and usage by sharing probability level](assets/export-report.png){align="left"}

   *Export Number of accounts and usage by sharing probability level*

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Export]** option located in the upper-right corner of the data panel.

1. The file will automatically download to your local machine.

   The system saves the data for number of accounts and usage by sharing probability level in a CSV file.

1. Find the file on your local machine to open and access the data.

The columns in the exported report are displayed below.
