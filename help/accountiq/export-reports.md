# Export data panel reports {#export-reports}

The Dashboard in [!UICONTROL Account IQ] displays tables and graphs for analyzing credential sharing statistics of the subscriber accounts in the selected segment. Apart from viewing the sharing patterns, scores, and account usage metrics, you can also export reports from these tables.

As a programmer and MVPD user, you can export the following data panel reports:

* [MVPDs and Programmers in segment](data-panels.md#mvpds-programmers-segment) 
* [Number of accounts and usage by sharing probability level](data-panels.md#number-of-accounts-usage-sharing-probability)

To export data panel reports for a specific segment, follow these steps:

1. Log in with your authorized programmer or MVPD credentials.
1. Select a desired segment and time interval from segment and time interval panel. Know [how to select segment and time interval](segments-timeinterval.md).

   If required, refer to the instructions for [creating a new segment](work-with-segments.md#create-new-segment) or [editing a segment](work-with-segments.md#edit-segment).

1. Navigate to the data panel you want to export. 

   For example, below we refer to **Number of accounts and usage by sharing probability level**.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Export]** option located in the upper-right corner of the data panel.
1. If given the option, choose the location to save the file on your local machine, optionally rename your file in the **File name**, and select **[!UICONTROL Save]**. Alternatively, the file will automatically be saved to the download folder designated by your browser.

   The system saves the data for **Number of accounts and usage by sharing probability level** to the specified location on your local machine.

1. Find the exported file on your local machine to open and access the data.
