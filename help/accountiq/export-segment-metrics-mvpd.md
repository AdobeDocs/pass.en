The Dashboard in [!UICONTROL Account IQ] displays tables and graphs for credential sharing statistics of the subscriber accounts in the selected segment. Apart from viewing the sharing patterns and scores, you can also export the account usage metrics and sharing scores for the subscribers of the MVPDs and channels in the selected segment from these tables.

1. Go to one of the following panels:
