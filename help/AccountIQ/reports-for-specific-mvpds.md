# View account sharing reports for a specific MVPD <!--and programmer--> {#report-sp-mvpd}

If you are logged in to Account IQ application as a [programmer](/help/AccountIQ/product-concepts.md#programmer-def), then you can view reports of sharing on your channels for specific [MVPD](/help/AccountIQ/product-concepts.md#mvpd-def) subscribers.

To view reports in Account IQ, once you have successfully logged in to the application as a programmer:

1. Select the specific MVPD as you define your subscriber segment for analysis and viewing reports using steps in [How to define segment](/help/AccountIQ/howto-select-segment-timeframe.md).

   >You can select one, two, or multiple channels, or even default selection of top 10 channels (by sharing score, usage, or accounts).
   >
   >
   >However, you can select [at most 10 channels](/help/AccountIQ/limitations.md) from the channels selector in the [segment and time frame panel](/help/AccountIQ/segments-timeframe.md).
