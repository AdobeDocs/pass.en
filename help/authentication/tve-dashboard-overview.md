The [[!DNL Adobe] Pass TVE Dashboard](https://console.auth.adobe.com/) is a tool for Adobe Pass Authentication customers (Programmers) to manage their configuration and data. This self-service dashboard enables a range of functionalities, such as:

* **Integration management**: Add new integrations between respective brands (Channels) of a programmer and Multichannel Video Programming Distributors (MVPDs) in the Adobe Pass Authentication ecosystem.

* **Property configuration**: Configure multiple properties for each integration to implement granular business rules customized to specific platform needs.

* **Report generation**: Access and export detailed reports on configuration setup across MVPDs. These reports include:
    * Platform categories such as *Desktop, Mobile, and TV Connected Devices* 
    * Platforms such as *iOS, Android&trade;, tvOS, Roku, and FireTV*
    
    The reports provide insights into Single Sign-On (SSO) support and subscriber authentication or authorization session duration at MVPD and platform levels.

* **Traffic visualization**: Visualize high-level authentication and authorization traffic data of the programmer properties.

Contact your Technical Account Manager (TAM) to access the TVE Dashboard. This access requires configuring two new user groups within your Adobe Marketing Cloud Organization:

* **TVE Dashboard Read-Write**: Members of this group have full editing rights across all sections of the dashboard.
* **TVE Dashboard Read-Only**: Members of this group have viewing rights only across the entire dashboard.
