The [[!DNL Adobe] Pass TVE Dashboard](https://console.auth.adobe.com/) is a primary tool for Adobe Pass Authentication customers (Programmers) to manage their configurations and data. This self-service dashboard enables a range of functionalities, such as:

* **Integration management**: Add new integrations between the associated channels and Multichannel Video Programming Distributors (MVPDs) in the Adobe Pass Authentication ecosystem.

* **Property configuration**: Configure multiple properties for each integration to implement granular business rules customized to specific platform needs.

* **Report generation**: Access and export detailed reports on configuration setups across MVPDs, including various platform categories like *Desktop, Mobile, and TV Connected Devices*, and platforms like *iOS, Android, tvOS, Roku, and FireTV*. These reports provide insights into single sign-on (SSO) support and subscriber authentication or authorization session duration at MVPD and platform levels.

* **Traffic visualization**: Visualize high-level authentication and authorization traffic data for the properties of a programmer.

To access TVE Dashboard, reach out to your Technical Account Manager (TAM). This access requires configuring two new user groups within your Adobe Marketing Cloud Organization:

* **TVE Dashboard Read-Write**: Members of this group have full editing rights across all sections of the dashboard.
* **TVE Dashboard Read-Only**: Members of this group have viewing rights only across the entire dashboard.
