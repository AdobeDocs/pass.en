The [[!DNL Adobe] Pass TVE Dashboard](https://console.auth.adobe.com/) is a primary tool for Adobe Pass Authentication customers (Programmers) to manage their configurations and data. This self-service dashboard is designed to enable a range of following functionalities:

* **Integration Management**: Add new integrations between the associated channels and Multichannel Video Programming Distributor (MVPD) in the Adobe Pass ecosystem.

* **Property Configuration**: Configure multiple properties for each integration to implement granular business rules customized to specific needs.
