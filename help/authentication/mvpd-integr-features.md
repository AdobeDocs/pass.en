## Overview {#mvpd-int-features-overview}

Adobe Primetime authentication supports the emerging standards for TV Everywhere. It is compliant with the **CableLabs OLCA (Online Content Access) specification**, which provides technical requirements and architecture for the delivery of video to a Pay TV customer from online sources. Adobe participated in the joint CableLabs interopt testing project in June 2011 and passed the testing process for a Service Provider implementation.  Adobe is also an active member of the **OATC (Open Authentication Technical Consortium)** and participates in several of the subcommittees' specification-drafting projects as part of that body. 

Having described Primetime authentication OLCA compliance, and Adobe's participation in OATC, it is also important to note that Primetime authentication is actually "protocol agnostic".  But at this stage of the TVE era, Primetime authentication  is definitely oriented toward the OLCA standards.  The standards delineate currently agreed-upon ways for the different TVE players (Programmers, MVPDs, and Service Providers) to implement TVE features. Many of these features are listed in the tables below, with links to related pages that provide details and examples of how to implement the features. 

The information in the tables is intended to drive the Primetime authentication integration process towards consistent functionality across all MVPD integrations. The priority column ranks the features into A, B, and C:

* A - These are "must have" features for the initial roll-out of an integration.
* B - These are important enhancements to the initial integration, to be added after the initial roll-out.
* C - These are further enhancements to the integration that can be implemented after the 'B' requirements.

The AuthN session is shared between the brands. SSO support is for both websites and mobile / device applications.  For MVPDs, it requires returning either a User ID or some other user token that can be used for AuthZ across brands. |     A    |                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1.5  | Device-optimized Login User Experience (UX)                    | The MVPD supports resizing the login screen so that it fits the dimensions of the device the view is using.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |     A    |                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1.6  | Default MVPD Picker Logo                                       | The MVPD provides a URL to a default logo of appropriate dimensions (112x33 pixels).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |     A    | The logo should be hosted by the MVPD and should be cached by CDN.                                                                                      |

| 1.8  | [Multiple Channel Authorization](/help/authentication/mvpd-preflight-authz.md#preflight-multich-authz)                                 | The MVPD supports a Programmer sending multiple channels in a single authorization request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |    B+    |                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1.9  | iFrame or "JS Pop-up" based Authentication                     | The Programmer is able to integrate the login flow into an iFrame or pop-up experience instead of an HTTP redirect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |     B    |                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1.10 | [Programmer-initiated Logout](/help/authentication/usecase-mvpd-logout.md)                                    | The viewer has an authenticated session both on the Programmer's Site or App and with the MVPD. The viewer can initiate a federated logout from the Programmer's site, and the logout also clears the session on the MVPD portal.                                                                                                                                        |     B    | Ensures shared computers are more protected from misuse from the Programmer perspective.                                                                |
| 1.11 | [Custom Authorization Error Messaging](/help/authentication/error-reporting.md)                           | The MVPD passes its own custom error string, which is appropriate for the Programmer's federated Site or App to display to the user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |     B    | Enables up-sell scenarios                                                                                                                               |
| 1.12 | **User Metadata on Authentication Response**                       | The MVPD AuthN response can include user metadata that acts as a hint for personalization of the user's experience during the entitlement flow. This requirement enables parental control hints from the MVPD to the Programmer.                                                                                                                                         |    B-    |                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1.13 | MVPD-initiated Authentication                                  | The viewer completes a successful AuthN session on the MVPD portal, and then navigates to the Programmer's TVE site. The user is not prompted for the MVPD picker and is automatically authenticated.                                                                                                                                                                    |    B-    |                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1.14 | UserID Scoping                                                 | The MVPD UserID should occur in two forms - one scoped to Programmers and the other scoped Adobe-wide for fraud.  This allows Adobe to share the Programmer-scoped MVPD UserID without further encryption / obfuscation.                                                                                                                                                 |     C    |                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1.15 | Asset-based Authorization                                      | Once AuthN is completed, AuthZ can happen in the background, by passing structured data that can include network, show, asset, parental control rating, and more as needed. This enables parental controls on every AuthZ call from the Programmer to the MVPD.                                                                                                          |     C    |                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1.16 | MVPD-initiated Logout                                          | The viewer has an authenticated session both on the Programmer's site or app and with the MVPD. The viewer can initiate a federated logout from the MVPD's site that also clears the session on all federated Programmer sites.                                                                                                                                          |     C    |                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1.17 | Authorization Obligations                                      | The MVPD provides additional conditions in the AuthZ response, such as logging, or a refreshed maximum parental control rating (OLCA).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |     C    |                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1.18 | IP Address Context                                             | The MVPD requires explicitly passing the IP address. For AuthZ, where the calls are server-side, this gives the MVPD fraud tracking information about where the user is coming from on the AuthZ call.                                                                                                                                                                   |     C    |                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1.19 | Token Persistence Time-to-live (TTL) Value Dynamically Defined | The MVPD is able to set the TTL of the Primetime authentication token dynamically through properties in the response, so that Adobe is out of the loop for TTL changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |    C-    |                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1.20 | Device Type                                                    | The MVPD supports passing the device type in the AuthN or AuthZ request. This property informs the MVPD as to the nature of the device where the content will be consumed, so they could adjust the TTL of the AuthN or AuthZ token to conform to their own security considerations for the device.                                                                      |    C-    | This is helpful for the clientless platform, where it may be hard to expose every device type as a config setting on the Primetime authentication side. |
