Adobe Pass Authentication is a powerful entitlement solution for TV Everywhere (TVE), designed to streamline and secure the process of verifying whether viewers are entitled to access protected content. This modular framework connects Content Providers (Programmers) with Pay TV Providers (MVPDs), facilitating entitlement transactions with speed, consistency, and reliability.

In the TVE ecosystem, Programmers supply content while MVPDs manage subscriber data. This dynamic can be challenging, especially when navigating the diverse systems of numerous MVPDs. Adobe Pass Authentication eliminates these complexities by providing a single integration point that connects both parties to the broader TVE landscape.

For Programmers, Adobe Pass Authentication ensures secure access to eligible viewers while reducing the technical burden of entitlement verification. For MVPDs, it offers a scalable solution to connect with multiple content providers through a unified interface, strengthening customer relationships and enhancing the viewer experience.

As a SaaS (Software as a Service) solution, Adobe Pass Authentication speeds up time-to-market, mitigates fraud risks, and enables seamless cross-platform content access, ensuring that the right viewers receive the right content effortlessly.
