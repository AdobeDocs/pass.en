### Configuration Phase FAQs {#configuration-phase-faqs-general}

+++Configuration Phase FAQs

#### 1. What's the purpose of the Configuration Phase? {#configuration-phase-faq1}

The purpose of the Configuration Phase is to provide the client application the list of MVPDs with which it is actively integrated along with configuration details (e.g., `id`, `displayName`, `logoUrl`, etc.) saved by Adobe Pass Authentication for each MVPD.

The Configuration Phase acts as a prerequisite step for the Authentication Phase when the client application needs to ask the user to select their TV Provider.

#### 2. Is the Configuration Phase mandatory? {#configuration-phase-faq2}

The Configuration Phase is not mandatory, the client application must retrieve the configuration only when the user needs to select their MVPD to authenticate or re-authenticate.

The client application can skip this phase in the following scenarios:

* The user is already authenticated.
* The user is offered temporary access through basic or promotional [TempPass](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/features-premium/temporary-access/temp-pass-feature.md) feature.
* The user authentication has expired, but the client application has cached the previously selected MVPD as a user experience motivated choice, and just prompts the user to confirm that they are still a subscriber of that MVPD.

#### 3. What's a configuration and how long is it valid? {#configuration-phase-faq3}

The configuration is a term defined in the [Glossary](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/rest-api-v2-glossary.md#configuration) documentation.

The configuration contains a list of MVPDs defined by the following attributes `id`, `displayName`, `logoUrl`, etc., that can be retrieved from the [Configuration](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/configuration-apis/rest-api-v2-configuration-apis-retrieve-configuration-for-specific-service-provider.md) endpoint.

The client application must retrieve the configuration only when the user needs to select their MVPD to authenticate or re-authenticate.

The client application can use the configuration response to present a UI picker with available MVPD options whenever the user needs to select their TV provider.

The client application must store the user's selected MVPD identifier, as specified by the MVPD's configuration-level `id` attribute, to proceed with the Authentication, Preauthorization, Authorization, or Logout phases.

For more information, refer to the [Retrieve configuration](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/configuration-apis/rest-api-v2-configuration-apis-retrieve-configuration-for-specific-service-provider.md) documentation.

#### 4. Should the client application cache the configuration response information in a persistent storage? {#configuration-phase-faq4}

The client application must retrieve the configuration only when the user needs to select their MVPD to authenticate or re-authenticate.

The client application should cache the configuration response information in a memory storage to avoid unnecessary requests and improve the user experience when:

* The user is already authenticated.
* The user is offered temporary access through basic or promotional [TempPass](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/features-premium/temporary-access/temp-pass-feature.md) feature.
* The user authentication has expired, but the client application has cached the previously selected MVPD as a user experience motivated choice, and just prompts the user to confirm that they are still a subscriber of that MVPD.

#### 5. Can the client application manage its own list of MVPDs? {#configuration-phase-faq5}

The client application can manage its own list of MVPDs, but it would require to keep the MVPD identifiers in sync with Adobe Pass Authentication. Therefore, it is recommended to use the configuration provided by Adobe Pass Authentication to ensure the list is up to date and accurate.

The client application would receive an [error](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/features-standard/error-reporting/enhanced-error-codes.md#enhanced-error-codes-lists-rest-api-v2) from Adobe Pass Authentication REST API V2 if the provided MVPD identifier is invalid or in case it does not have an active integration with the specified [service provider](rest-api-v2-glossary.md#service-provider).

#### 6. Can the client application filter the list of MVPDs? {#configuration-phase-faq6}

The client application can filter the list of MVPDs provided in the configuration response by implementing a custom mechanism based on its own business logic and requirements such as user location or user history of previous selection.

The client application can filter the list of [TempPass](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/features-premium/temporary-access/temp-pass-feature.md) MVPDs or the MVPDs that have their integration still in development or testing.

#### 7. What happens if the integration with an MVPD is disabled and marked as inactive? {#configuration-phase-faq7}

When the integration with an MVPD is disabled and marked as inactive, then the MVPD is removed from the list of MVPDs provided in further configuration responses, and there are two important consequences to consider:

* The unauthenticated users of that MVPD will no longer be able to complete the Authentication Phase using that MVPD.
* The authenticated users of that MVPD will no longer be able to complete the Preauthorization, Authorization, or Logout Phases using that MVPD.

The client application would receive an [error](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/features-standard/error-reporting/enhanced-error-codes.md#enhanced-error-codes-lists-rest-api-v2) from Adobe Pass Authentication REST API V2 if the user selected MVPD does not have anymore an active integration with the specified [service provider](rest-api-v2-glossary.md#service-provider).

#### 8. What happens if the integration with an MVPD is enabled back and marked as active? {#configuration-phase-faq8}

When the integration with an MVPD is enabled back and marked as active, then the MVPD is included back in the list of MVPDs provided in further configuration responses, and there are two important consequences to consider:

* The unauthenticated users of that MVPD will be able again to complete the Authentication Phase using that MVPD.
* The authenticated users of that MVPD will be able again to complete the Preauthorization, Authorization, or Logout Phases using that MVPD.

#### 9. How to enable or disable the integration with an MVPD? {#configuration-phase-faq9}

This operation can be completed through the Adobe Pass [TVE Dashboard](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/rest-api-v2-glossary.md#tve-dashboard) by one of your organization administrators or by an Adobe Pass Authentication representative acting on your behalf.

For more details, refer to the [TVE Dashboard Integrations User Guide](/help/authentication/user-guide-tve-dashboard/tve-dashboard-integrations.md#disable-integration) documentation.

### Authentication Phase FAQs {#authentication-phase-faqs-general}

+++Authentication Phase FAQs

#### 1. What's the purpose of the Authentication Phase? {#authentication-phase-faq1}

The purpose of the Authentication Phase is to provide the client application the capability to verify the user's identity and obtain user metadata information.

The Authentication Phase acts as a prerequisite step for the Preauthorization Phase or Authorization Phase when the client application needs to play content.

#### 2. What's an authentication session and how long is it valid? {#authentication-phase-faq2}

The authentication session is a term defined in the [Glossary](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/rest-api-v2-glossary.md#session) documentation.

The authentication session stores information about the initiated authentication process that can be retrieved from the Sessions endpoint.

The authentication session is valid for a limited and short timeframe specified at the moment of issue by the `notAfter` timestamp, indicating the amount of time the user has to complete the authentication process before requiring to restart the flow.

The client application can use the authentication session response to know how to proceed with the authentication process. Take notice that there are cases in which the user is not required to authenticate, such as providing temporary access, degraded access, or when the user is already authenticated.

For more information, refer to the following documents:

* [Create authentication session API](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/sessions-apis/rest-api-v2-sessions-apis-create-authentication-session.md)
* [Resume authentication session API](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/sessions-apis/rest-api-v2-sessions-apis-resume-authentication-session.md)
* [Basic authentication flow performed within primary application](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/flows/basic-access-flows/rest-api-v2-basic-authentication-primary-application-flow.md)
* [Basic authentication flow performed within secondary application](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/flows/basic-access-flows/rest-api-v2-basic-authentication-secondary-application-flow.md)

#### 3. What's an authentication code and how long is it valid? {#authentication-phase-faq3}

The authentication code is a term defined in the [Glossary](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/rest-api-v2-glossary.md#code) documentation.

The authentication code stores a unique value generated when a user initiates the authentication process, and uniquely identifies a user's authentication session until the process is complete or until the authentication session expires.

The authentication code is valid for a limited and short timeframe specified at the moment of initiating the authentication session by the `notAfter` timestamp, indicating the amount of time the user has to complete the authentication process before requiring to restart the flow.

The client application can use the authentication code to verify whether the user has successfully completed authentication and retrieve the user's profile information, typically through a polling mechanism.

The client application can also use the authentication code to allow the user to complete or resume the authentication process either on the same device or on a second (screen) one, considering that the authentication session did not expire.

For more information, refer to the following documents:

* [Create authentication session API](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/sessions-apis/rest-api-v2-sessions-apis-create-authentication-session.md)
* [Resume authentication session API](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/sessions-apis/rest-api-v2-sessions-apis-resume-authentication-session.md)
* [Basic authentication flow performed within primary application](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/flows/basic-access-flows/rest-api-v2-basic-authentication-primary-application-flow.md)
* [Basic authentication flow performed within secondary application](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/flows/basic-access-flows/rest-api-v2-basic-authentication-secondary-application-flow.md)

#### 4. How can the client application know if the user typed a valid authentication code and that the authentication session did not expire yet? {#authentication-phase-faq4}

The client application can validate the authentication code that is typed by the user in a secondary (screen) application by sending a request to one of the Sessions endpoint responsible to resume authentication session or retrieve authentication session information associated with the authentication code.

The client application would receive an [error](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/features-standard/error-reporting/enhanced-error-codes.md#enhanced-error-codes-lists-rest-api-v2) if the provided authentication code was typed wrong or in case the authentication session would be expired.

For more information, refer to the [Resume authentication session](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/sessions-apis/rest-api-v2-sessions-apis-resume-authentication-session.md) and [Retrieve authentication session](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/sessions-apis/rest-api-v2-sessions-apis-retrieve-authentication-session-information-using-code.md) documents.

#### 5. How can the client application know if the user is already authenticated? {#authentication-phase-faq5}

The client application can query one of the following endpoints capable of verifying if a user is already authenticated and return profile information:

* [Profiles endpoint API](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/profiles-apis/rest-api-v2-profiles-apis-retrieve-profiles.md)
* [Profiles endpoint for specific MVPD API](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/profiles-apis/rest-api-v2-profiles-apis-retrieve-profile-for-specific-mvpd.md)
* [Profiles endpoint for specific (authentication) code API](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/profiles-apis/rest-api-v2-profiles-apis-retrieve-profile-for-specific-code.md)

For more details, refer to the following documents:

* [Basic profiles flow performed within primary application](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/flows/basic-access-flows/rest-api-v2-basic-profiles-primary-application-flow.md)
* [Basic profiles flow performed within secondary application](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/flows/basic-access-flows/rest-api-v2-basic-profiles-secondary-application-flow.md)

#### 6. What's a profile and how long is it valid? {#authentication-phase-faq6}

The profile is a term defined in the [Glossary](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/rest-api-v2-glossary.md#profile) documentation.

The profile stores information about the user's authentication validity, metadata information and many more that can be retrieved from the Profiles endpoint.

The client application can use the profile to know the user's authentication status, access user metadata information, find the method used to authenticate or the entity used to provide identity.

For more details, refer to the following documents:

* [Profiles endpoint API](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/profiles-apis/rest-api-v2-profiles-apis-retrieve-profiles.md)
* [Profiles endpoint for specific MVPD API](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/profiles-apis/rest-api-v2-profiles-apis-retrieve-profile-for-specific-mvpd.md)
* [Profiles endpoint for specific (authentication) code API](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/profiles-apis/rest-api-v2-profiles-apis-retrieve-profile-for-specific-code.md)
* [Basic profiles flow performed within primary application](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/flows/basic-access-flows/rest-api-v2-basic-profiles-primary-application-flow.md)
* [Basic profiles flow performed within secondary application](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/flows/basic-access-flows/rest-api-v2-basic-profiles-secondary-application-flow.md)

The profile is valid for a limited timeframe specified when queried by the `notAfter` timestamp, indicating the amount of time the user has a valid authentication before requiring to go through the Authentication Phase again.

This limited timeframe known as authentication (authN) [TTL](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/rest-api-v2-glossary.md#ttl) can be viewed and changed through the Adobe Pass [TVE Dashboard](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/rest-api-v2-glossary.md#tve-dashboard) by one of your organization administrators or by an Adobe Pass Authentication representative acting on your behalf.

For more details, refer to the [TVE Dashboard Integrations User Guide](/help/authentication/user-guide-tve-dashboard/tve-dashboard-integrations.md#most-used-flows) documentation.

#### 7. Should the client application cache the user's profile information in a persistent storage? {#authentication-phase-faq7}

The client application should cache the user's profile information in a persistent storage to avoid unnecessary requests and improve the user experience considering the following aspects:

| Attribute    | User Experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `attributes` | The client application can use this to personalize the user experience based on different [user metadata](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/features-standard/entitlements/user-metadata.md) keys (e.g., `zip`, `maxRating`, etc.).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `mvpd`       | The client application can use this to keep track of the user's selected TV provider.<br/><br/>When the current user profile expires, the client application can use the remembered MVPD selection and just ask the user to confirm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `notAfter`   | The client application can use this to keep track of user profile expiration date and trigger the re-authentication process when it expires, avoiding errors during Preauthorization or Authorization Phases.<br/><br/>The client application error handling must be able to handle the [authenticated_profile_expired](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/features-standard/error-reporting/enhanced-error-codes.md#enhanced-error-codes-lists-rest-api-v2) error code, which indicates that the client application requires the user to re-authenticate. |

#### 8. Can the client application extend the user's profile without requiring re-authentication? {#authentication-phase-faq8}

No.

The user profile cannot be extended beyond its validity without user interaction, as its expiration is determined by the authentication TTL established with MVPDs.

Therefore, the client application must prompt the user to re-authenticate and interact with the MVPD login page to refresh their profile on our system.

However, for MVPDs that support [home-based authentication](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/features-standard/hba-access/home-based-authentication.md) (HBA), the user will not be required to enter credentials.

#### 9. What are the use cases for each available Profiles endpoint? {#authentication-phase-faq9}

The Profiles endpoints are designed to provide client application the capability to know the user's authentication status, access user metadata information, find the method used to authenticate or the entity used to provide identity.

Each endpoint suits a specific use case, as follows:

| API                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Description                                                               | Use case                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

#### 10. What should the client application do if the user has multiple MVPD profiles? {#authentication-phase-faq10}

When the user has multiple MVPD profiles, the client application is responsible to determine the best approach for handling this scenario.

The client application may choose to prompt the user to select the desired MVPD profile or make the selection automatically, such as choosing the first user profile from the response or the one with the longest validity period.

#### 11. What happens when user profiles expire? {#authentication-phase-faq11}

When user profiles expire, they are no longer included in the response from the Profiles endpoint.

If the Profiles endpoint returns an empty profiles map response, the client application must create a new authentication session and prompt the user to re-authenticate.

For more information, refer to the [Create authentication session API](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/sessions-apis/rest-api-v2-sessions-apis-create-authentication-session.md) documentation.

#### 12. When do user profiles become invalid? {#authentication-phase-faq12}

User profiles become invalid in the following scenarios:

* When the authentication TTL expires, as indicated by the `notAfter` timestamp in the Profiles endpoint response.
* When the client application changes the [AP-Device-Identifier](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/appendix/headers/rest-api-v2-appendix-headers-ap-device-identifier.md) header value.
* When the client application updates the client credentials used to retrieve the [Authorization](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/appendix/headers/rest-api-v2-appendix-headers-authorization.md) header value.
* When the client application revokes or updates the software statement used to obtain client credentials.

#### 13. When should the client application start the polling mechanism? {#authentication-phase-faq13}

To ensure efficiency and avoid unnecessary requests, the client application must start the polling mechanism under the following conditions:

**Authentication performed within the primary (screen) application**

The primary (streaming) application should start polling when the user reaches the final destination page, after the browser component loads the URL specified for the `redirectUrl` parameter in the [Sessions](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/sessions-apis/rest-api-v2-sessions-apis-create-authentication-session.md) endpoint request.

**Authentication performed within a secondary (screen) application**

The primary (streaming) application should start polling as soon as the user initiates the authentication process—right after receiving the [Sessions](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/sessions-apis/rest-api-v2-sessions-apis-create-authentication-session.md) endpoint response and displaying the authentication code to the user.

#### 14. When should the client application stop the polling mechanism? {#authentication-phase-faq14}

To ensure efficiency and avoid unnecessary requests, the client application must stop the polling mechanism under the following conditions:

**Successful authentication** 

The user's profile information is successfully retrieved, confirming their authentication status. At this point, polling is no longer needed.

**Authentication session and code expiry**

The authentication session and code expire, as indicated by the `notAfter` timestamp in the [Sessions](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/sessions-apis/rest-api-v2-sessions-apis-create-authentication-session.md) endpoint response. If this happens, the user must restart the authentication process, and polling using the previous authentication code should be stopped immediately.

**New authentication code generated** 

If the user requests a new authentication code on the primary (screen) device, the existing session is no longer valid, and polling using the previous authentication code should be stopped immediately.

#### 15. What interval between calls should the client application use for the polling mechanism? {#authentication-phase-faq15}

To ensure efficiency and avoid unnecessary requests, the client application must configure the polling mechanism frequency under the following conditions:

| **Authentication performed within the primary (screen) application** | **Authentication performed within a secondary (screen) application** |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The primary (streaming) application should poll every 1-5 seconds.   | The primary (streaming) application should poll every 3-5 seconds.   |

#### 16. What's the maximum number of polling requests the client application can send? {#authentication-phase-faq16}

The client application must adhere to the current limits defined by the Adobe Pass Authentication [Throttling Mechanism](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/throttling-mechanism.md#throttling-mechanism-limits).

The client application error handling must be able to handle the [429 Too Many Requests](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/throttling-mechanism.md#throttling-mechanism-response) error code, which indicates that the client application has exceeded the maximum number of requests allowed.

For more details, refer to the [Throttling Mechanism](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/throttling-mechanism.md) documentation.

#### 17. How can the client application get the user's metadata information? {#authentication-phase-faq17}

The client application can query one of the following endpoints capable to return [user metadata](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/features-standard/entitlements/user-metadata.md) information as part of the profile information:

* [Profiles endpoint API](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/profiles-apis/rest-api-v2-profiles-apis-retrieve-profiles.md)
* [Profiles endpoint for specific MVPD API](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/profiles-apis/rest-api-v2-profiles-apis-retrieve-profile-for-specific-mvpd.md)
* [Profiles endpoint for specific (authentication) code API](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/profiles-apis/rest-api-v2-profiles-apis-retrieve-profile-for-specific-code.md)

The client application does not need to query a separate endpoint to retrieve the user's metadata information, as it is already included in the profile information obtained when verifying if the user is authenticated.

For more details, refer to the following documents:

* [Basic profiles flow performed within primary application](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/flows/basic-access-flows/rest-api-v2-basic-profiles-primary-application-flow.md)
* [Basic profiles flow performed within secondary application](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/flows/basic-access-flows/rest-api-v2-basic-profiles-secondary-application-flow.md)

#### 18. How should the client application manage degraded access? {#authentication-phase-faq18}

Given that your organization intends to use the [degradation](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/features-premium/degraded-access/degradation-feature.md) feature, the client application must handle degraded access flows, which outline how REST API v2 endpoints behave in such scenarios.

For more details, refer to the [Degraded access flows](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/flows/degraded-access-flows/rest-api-v2-access-degraded-flows.md) documentation.

### Preauthorization Phase FAQs {#preauthorization-phase-faqs-general}

+++Preauthorization Phase FAQs

#### 1. What's the purpose of the Preauthorization Phase? {#preauthorization-phase-faq1}

The purpose of the Preauthorization Phase is to provide the client application the capability to present a subset of resources from its catalog that the user would be entitled to access.

The Preauthorization Phase can enhance the user experience when the user opens the client application for the first time or navigates to a new section.

#### 2. Is the Preauthorization Phase mandatory? {#preauthorization-phase-faq2}

The Preauthorization Phase is not mandatory, the client application can skip this phase if it wants to present a catalog of resources without filtering them first based on the user's entitlement.

#### 3. What's a preauthorization decision? {#preauthorization-phase-faq3}

The preauthorization is a term defined in the [Glossary](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/rest-api-v2-glossary.md#preauthorization) documentation, while the decision term can also be found in the [Glossary](rest-api-v2-glossary.md#decision).

The preauthorization decision stores information about the MVPD preauthorization process enquiry result that can be retrieved from the Decisions Preauthorize endpoint.

The client application can use the preauthorization decisions to present a subset of resources the TV Provider (informative) decisions would allow the user to access.

For more details, refer to the following documents:

* [Retrieve preauthorization decisions API](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/decisions-apis/rest-api-v2-decisions-apis-retrieve-preauthorization-decisions-using-specific-mvpd.md)
* [Basic preauthorization flow performed within primary application](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/flows/basic-access-flows/rest-api-v2-basic-preauthorization-primary-application-flow.md)

#### 4. Why is the preauthorization decision missing a media token? {#preauthorization-phase-faq4}

The preauthorization decision is missing a media token because the Preauthorization Phase must not be used to play resources, as that is the purpose of the Authorization Phase.

#### 5. What is a resource and what formats are supported? {#preauthorization-phase-faq5}

The resource is a term defined in the [Glossary](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/rest-api-v2-glossary.md#resource) documentation.

The resource is a unique identifier that is agreed upon with MVPDs and is associated with a content that the client application could stream.

The resource unique identifier can have two formats:

* A simple string format such as a unique identifier for a channel (brand).
* A media RSS (MRSS) format containing additional information such as the title, ratings and parental-control metadata.

For more details, refer to the [Protected Resources](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/features-standard/entitlements/decisions.md#protected-resources) documentation.

#### 6. For how many resources can the client application obtain a preauthorization decision at a time? {#preauthorization-phase-faq6}

The client application can obtain a preauthorization decision for a limited number of resources in a single API request, usually up to 5, due to conditions imposed by MVPDs.

This maximum number of resources can be viewed and changed after agreeing with MVPDs through the Adobe Pass [TVE Dashboard](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/rest-api-v2-glossary.md#tve-dashboard) by one of your organization administrators or by an Adobe Pass Authentication representative acting on your behalf.

For more details, refer to the [TVE Dashboard Integrations User Guide](/help/authentication/user-guide-tve-dashboard/tve-dashboard-integrations.md#add-more-properties) documentation.

### Authorization Phase FAQs {#authorization-phase-faqs-general}

+++Authorization Phase FAQs

#### 1. What's the purpose of the Authorization Phase? {#authorization-phase-faq1}

The purpose of the Authorization Phase is to provide the client application the capability to play resources the user requests after validating their rights with the MVPD.

#### 2. Is the Authorization Phase mandatory? {#authorization-phase-faq2}

The Authorization Phase is mandatory, the client application cannot skip this phase if it wants to play resources the user requests, as it requires verifying with the MVPD that the user is entitled before releasing the stream.

#### 3. What's an authorization decision and how long is it valid? {#authorization-phase-faq3}

The authorization is a term defined in the [Glossary](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/rest-api-v2-glossary.md#authorization) documentation, while the decision term can also be found in the [Glossary](rest-api-v2-glossary.md#decision).

The authorization decision stores information about the MVPD authorization process enquiry result that can be retrieved from the Decisions Authorize endpoint.

The client application can use the authorization decision containing a media token to play the resource stream in case the TV Provider (authoritative) decision would allow the user to access it.

For more details, refer to the following documents:

* [Retrieve authorization decisions API](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/decisions-apis/rest-api-v2-decisions-apis-retrieve-authorization-decisions-using-specific-mvpd.md)
* [Basic authorization flow performed within primary application](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/flows/basic-access-flows/rest-api-v2-basic-authorization-primary-application-flow.md)

The authorization decision is valid for a limited and short timeframe specified at the moment of issue, indicating the amount of time it will be cached by Adobe Pass Authentication before requiring to query the MVPD again.

This limited timeframe known as authorization (authZ) [TTL](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/rest-api-v2-glossary.md#ttl) can be viewed and changed through the Adobe Pass [TVE Dashboard](rest-api-v2-glossary.md#tve-dashboard) by one of your organization administrators or by an Adobe Pass Authentication representative acting on your behalf.

For more details, refer to the [TVE Dashboard Integrations User Guide](/help/authentication/user-guide-tve-dashboard/tve-dashboard-integrations.md#most-used-flows) documentation.

#### 4. What's a media token and how long is it valid? {#authorization-phase-faq4}

The media token is a term defined in the [Glossary](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/rest-api-v2-glossary.md#media-token) documentation.

The media token consists of a signed string sent in clear text that can be retrieved from the Decisions Authorize endpoint.

For more information, refer to the [Media Token Verifier](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/features-standard/entitlements/media-tokens.md#media-token-verifier) documentation.

The media token is valid for a limited and short timeframe specified at the moment of issue, indicating the amount of time it must be used by the client application before requiring to query the Decisions Authorize endpoint again.

The client application can use the media token to play a resource stream in case the TV Provider (authoritative) decision would allow the user to access it.

For more details, refer to the following documents:

* [Retrieve authorization decisions API](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/apis/decisions-apis/rest-api-v2-decisions-apis-retrieve-authorization-decisions-using-specific-mvpd.md)
* [Basic authorization flow performed within primary application](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/flows/basic-access-flows/rest-api-v2-basic-authorization-primary-application-flow.md)

#### 5. What is a resource and what formats are supported? {#authorization-phase-faq5}

The resource is a term defined in the [Glossary](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/rest-api-v2-glossary.md#resource) documentation.

The resource is a unique identifier that is agreed upon with MVPDs and is associated with a content that the client application could stream.

### Headers FAQs {#headers-faqs-general}

+++Headers FAQs

#### 1. How to compute the value for the Authorization header? {#headers-faq1}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> In case the client application is migrating from REST API V1 to REST API V2, the client application can continue to use the same method to obtain the `Bearer` access token value as before.

The [Authorization](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/appendix/headers/rest-api-v2-appendix-headers-authorization.md) request header contains the `Bearer` access token required by the client application to access Adobe Pass protected APIs.

The Authorization header value must be obtained from Adobe Pass Authentication during the Registration Phase.

For more details, refer to the following documents:

* [Dynamic Client Registration Overview](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-dcr/dynamic-client-registration-overview.md)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> In case the client application is migrating from REST API V1 to REST API V2, the client application can continue to use the same method to compute the device identifier value as before.

The [AP-Device-Identifier](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/appendix/headers/rest-api-v2-appendix-headers-ap-device-identifier.md) request header contains the streaming device identifier as it was created by the client application.

The [AP-Device-Identifier](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/appendix/headers/rest-api-v2-appendix-headers-ap-device-identifier.md) header documentation provides examples for major platforms of how to compute the value, but the client application can choose to use a different method based on its own business logic and requirements.

#### 3. How to compute the value for the X-Device-Info header? {#headers-faq3}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> In case the client application is migrating from REST API V1 to REST API V2, the client application can continue to use the same method to compute the device information value as before.

### General Migration FAQs {#general-migration-faqs}

+++General Migration FAQs

#### 1. Am I required to roll out a new client application migrated to REST API V2 to all users at once? {#migration-faq1}

No.

The client application is not required to roll out a new version integrating the REST API V2 to all users simultaneously.

Adobe Pass Authentication will continue to support older client application versions integrating the REST API V1 or SDK through the end of 2025.

#### 2. Am I required to roll out a new client application migrated to REST API V2 across all APIs and flows at once? {#migration-faq2}

Yes.

The client application is required to roll out a new version integrating the REST API V2 across all Adobe Pass Authentication APIs and flows simultaneously.

In case of the 'second screen authentication' flow, the client application is required to roll out a new version integrating the REST API V2 for both the [primary](rest-api-v2-glossary.md#primary-application) and [secondary](rest-api-v2-glossary.md#secondary-application) applications simultaneously.

Adobe Pass Authentication will not support 'hybrid' implementations that integrate both REST API V2 and REST API V1/SDK between APIs and flows.

#### 3. Will the user authentication be preserved when updating to a new client application migrated to REST API V2? {#migration-faq3}

No.

The user authentication obtained within older client application versions integrating the REST API V1 or SDK will not be preserved.

Therefore, the user will be required to re-authenticate within the new client application migrated to REST API V2.

#### 4. Are the enhanced error codes enabled by default in REST API V2? {#migration-faq4}

Yes.

The client applications migrating to REST API V2 automatically benefit from this feature by default, providing more detailed and precise error information.

For more details, refer to the [Enhanced Error Codes](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/features-standard/error-reporting/enhanced-error-codes.md#enhanced-error-codes-lists-rest-api-v2) documentation.

#### 5. Do existing integrations require configuration changes when migrating to REST API V2? {#migration-faq5}

No.

The client applications migrating to REST API V2 do not require any configuration changes for existing MVPD integrations. Also, they will continue to use the same identifiers for existing [service providers](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/rest-api-v2-glossary.md#service-provider) and [MVPDs](/help/authentication/integration-guide-programmers/rest-apis/rest-api-v2/rest-api-v2-glossary.md#mvpd).

Additionally, the protocols used by Adobe Pass Authentication to communicate with MVPD endpoints remain unchanged.
