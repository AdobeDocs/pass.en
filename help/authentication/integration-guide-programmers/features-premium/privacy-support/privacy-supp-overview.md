## Overview {#overview}

**GDPR**-The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a law in effect May 25, 2018, gives all individuals (data subjects) within the borders of the European Union (EU) control of their personal data and simplifies the regulatory environment for international business. This law applies to all business (data controllers) that offer goods or services to, monitor the behavior of, and collect personal data from individuals within the borders of the EU at the time their personal data is processed, regardless of the data controller's business location

**CCPA**-The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a law that provides California residents new rights regarding their personal information and imposes data protection responsibilities on certain entities whom conduct business in California. CCPA does utilize some concepts already known under GDPR, such as the right to access and delete personal information. However, there are other areas where CCPA differs from GDPR.

As an Adobe Pass Authentication customer, you can submit individual GDPR or CCPA privacy requests to access and delete customer data, either through the [Privacy Service UI](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experiencecloud/gdpr/docs/alldocs.html#!api-specification/markdown/narrative/tutorials/privacy_service_tutorial/privacy_service_ui_tutorial.md) or by calling the [Privacy Service API](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experiencecloud/gdpr/docs/alldocs.html#!api-specification/markdown/narrative/tutorials/privacy_service_tutorial/privacy_service_api_tutorial.md).
