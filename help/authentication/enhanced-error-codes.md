## Overview {#overview}

This document describes the list of API error codes and additional error information returned back to the applications.

To use Enhanced Error Codes in Programmers application, a request needs to be made to Support team in order to enable it with a configuration change.

## Response Error Handling {#response-error-handling}

In most scenarios, the Adobe Pass Authentication API include additional error information in the response body in order to provide **meaningful context** to why a certain error has occurred and/or possible solutions to automatically remediate the issue.  *However, in some specific cases involving authentication or logout flows, the Adobe Pass Authentication services might return an HTML response or an empty body - please check the API documentation for more information.*

While certain types of errors can be handled automatically (such as retrying an authorization request in case of a network timeout or require user to re-authenticate if their session has expired), other types might require configuration changes or customer care team interaction. It's important for Programmers to collect and provide full error information in such cases.

The Adobe Pass Authentication API returns HTTP Status codes in the range 400-500 to indicate failures or errors. Each HTTP status code has certain implications:

- The 4xx error codes imply that the error is generated by the client and that the client needs to do additional work to fix it (e.g. obtaining an access token before invoking protected APIs or provide any required parameter)

- The 5xx error codes imply that the error is generated by the server and that the server needs to do additional work to fix it.

The additional error information is included in the "error" field within the response body.

Adobe Pass APIs which handle multiple items (Preauthorization API,etc) might indicate if the processing has failed for a particular item and was successful for other items by using item-level error information. In this case, the ***"error"*** object is located at the item level and the response body might contain multiple ***"errors"*** objects - please consult the API documentation.

</br>

**Example with partial success and item-level error**

```json
{
   "resources" : [
        {
            "id" : "TestStream1",
            "authorized" : true
        },
        {
            "id" : "TestStream2",
            "authorized" : false,
            "error" : {
 
               "status" : 403,
               "code" : "network_connection_failure",
               "message" : "Unable to contact your TV provider services",
               "details" : "",
               "helpUrl" : "https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/pass/authentication/auth-features/error-reportn/enhanced-error-codes.html",
               "trace" : "8bcb17f9-b172-47d2-86d9-3eb146eba85e",
               "action" : "retry"
            }
 
        }
    ]
}
```

</br>

Each error object has the following parameters:

|Name|Type|Example|Restricted|Description|
|---|---|----|:---:|---|
|*status*|*integer*|*403*|&check;| The response HTTP status code as documented in RFC 7231 (<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6>) <ul><li>400 Bad Request</li><li>401 Unauthorized</li><li>403 Forbidden</li><li>404 Not found</li><li>405 Method not allowed</li><li>409 Conflict</li><li>410 Gone</li><li>412 Precondition failed</li><li>429 Too many requests</li><li>500 Interval server error</li><li>503 Service unavailable</li></ul> |
|*code*|*string*|*network_connection_failure*|&check;|The standard Adobe Pass Authentication error code. The complete list of error codes is included below.|
|*message*|*string*|*Unable to contact your TV provider services*| |Human readable message which can be displayed to the end user.|
|*details*|*string*|*Your subscription package does not include the "Live" channel*| |In some cases a detailed message is provided by the MVPD authorization endpoints or by the Programmer through degradation rules. <p> Note that If no custom message was received from the partner services then this field might not be present in the error fields.|
|*helpUrl*|*url*| "`http://`" | |A URL that links to more information about why this error occurred and possible solutions. <p>The URI represents an absolute URL and should not be inferred from error code. Depending on the error context, a different url can be provided. For example, same bad_request error code will yield different urls for authentication and authorization services.|
|*trace*|*string*| *12f6fef9-d2e0-422b-a9d7-60d799abe353*| |A unique identifier for this response which can be used when contacting support to identify specific issues in more complex scenarios.|
|*action*|*string*| *retry* |&check;|Recommended action to remediate the situation: <ul><li> *none* - Unfortunately there is no predefined action to remediate this issue. This might indicate an improper invocation of the public API</li><li>*configuration* - A configuration change is needed through TVE dashboard or by contacting support. </li><li>*application-registration* - The application must register itself again. </li><li>*authentication* - The user must authenticate or re-authenticate. </li><li>*authorization* - The user must obtain authorization for the specific resource. </li><li>*degradation* - Some form of degradation should be applied. </li><li>*retry* - Retrying the request might solve the issue</li><li>*retry-after* - Retrying the request after the indicated period of time might solve the issue.</li></ul>|

</br>

**Notes:**

- ***Restricted*** column *indicates if the respective field value represent a finite set* (for example existing HTTP status codes for "*status*" field). Future updates to this specification could add values to the restricted list but will not remove or change existing ones. Unrestricted fields usually can contain any data, but there might be limitations in place to ensure a reasonable size.
  
- Each Adobe response will contain an "Adobe-Request-Id" which identifies the client request throughout our HTTP services. The "**trace**" field complements that and they should reported together. 

## HTTP status codes and error codes {#http-status-codes-and-error-codes}

The inconsistencies between various error codes and their associated HTTP status codes are due because of the backwards compatibility requirements with older sdks and applications ( for
example *unknown\_application* yields 400 Bad Request while *unknown\_software\_statement* yields 401 Unauthorized). Solving those inconsistencies will be targeted in future iterations. 
 
## Actions and error codes {#actions-and-error-codes}

For most of the error codes, multiple actions could be eligible as paths toward fixing the issue at hand or even multiple actions might be required in order to automatically fix them. We opted for indicating the one with the highest probability to fix the error. The **actions** can be split in three categories:

1.  ones which try to fix the request context (retry, retry-after) 
1.  ones which try to fix the user context within the application
    (application-registration, authentication, authorization) 
1.  ones which try to fix the integration context between an application
    and an identity provider (configuration, degradation)

For the 1st category (retry and retry-after), simply retrying the same request might be enough to solve the issue. In cases of APIs which handle multiple items, the application should repeat the request and include only those items with "retry" or "retry-after" action. For "*retry-after*" action, a "<u>Retry-After</u>" header will indicate how many seconds the application should wait before repeating the request.

For the 2nd and 3rd category, the actual action implementation is highly dependent to the application features. For example, "*degradation*" can be implemented either as "switch to 15 minutes temporary passes to allow users playback of the content" or either as "automatic tool to apply AUTHN-ALL or AUTHZ-ALL degradation for its integration with the specified MVPD". Similar an "*authentication*" action can trigger a passive authentication (back-channel authentication) on a tablet and a full 2nd screen authentication flow on connected TVs. That's why we did opt for providing fully fledged URLs with schema and all parameters.

||*registration_code_service_unavailable* | 503 | The request failed because the registration code service is not available.|
||*service_unavailable* | 503  |  The request failed due to the fact that authentication or authorization service is not available.|
