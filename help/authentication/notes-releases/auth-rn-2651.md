### Release Overview {#release-overview-2651}

This release adds the following:

Starting with this release we’ll introduce technical support for adding rate limiting rules across all our APIs, in order to protect the overall ecosystem from incorrect usage.   
 
The initial goal will be to monitor applications behavior in order to establish the proper limit values and no limits will be applied as part of this release. For cases where the traffic generated by a specific application exceeds certain limits we’ll work with each customer to validate the implementation. 
 
Rate limiting rules will be applied later this year, after we validate traffic generated from all customer’s applications.
