The Changes Log section of the TVE Dashboard allows you to monitor the configuration changes pushed to the Adobe Pass Authentication environment through TVE Dashboard. You can also compare two different configuration changes.

The **Changes Log** tab in the left panel displays a list of configuration changes made through the TVE Dashboard. Each entry in this list provides the following details:

* **Change description**: A short description on the scope of configuration change.
* **Pushed by**: An email Id of the user responsible for making the change. 
* **Push date**: The date of the configuration change.
* **Push status**: Indicates whether the push operation was successful or failed.

## Compare changes {#compare-changes}

To compare changes, follow these steps:

1. Select any two configuration changes from the list you want to compare.
1. Select **Compare** at the upper-right of the screen.

The **Configuration Changes** section presents a list of all changed configuration entities.

To inspect a specific change, you can hover over the entity and select **view** to access the old and new values.
