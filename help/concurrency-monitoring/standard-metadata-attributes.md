# Standard metadata attributes {#std-metadata-attributes}

This page aims to provide an exhaustive list of metadata attributes that the Concurrency Monitoring service can process and which can be used as basis for policies that can be implemented. The standard metadata attributes can be categorized as follows:

* Attributes included by design (sent on every session initializaton call, as they are required in the URL path). No valid call can be performed without these values.
* Metadata attributes: values that need to be passed as form data during the session initialization call (should the backend policies require their values).

## Attributes required by design {#attr-req-by-design}

The Concurrency Monitoring API forces clients to send the following values as part of any valid initialization call: [session initiation calls](/help/concurrency-monitoring/restrict-concurr-usage-mult-apps.md#api-calls-descr). 

| Field Name | Example value | Where to use it | Obtained from |
|-------------|---------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| applicationId | 75b4-431b-adb2-eb6b9e546013 | Authorization header | Zendesk ticket at integration |
| mvpdName | Sample_MVPD | URI path | Adobe Pass Authentication from config endpoint when user selects the MVPD |
| accountId     | 12345 | URI path | Adobe Pass Authentication upstreamUserID metadata after user login [User Metadata upstreamUserID - Adobe Pass Authentication](/help/authentication/user-metadata-feature.md) |


## Metadata attributes {#metadata-attr}

The fields in the table below can be used by Programmers and MVPDs to create policies which will be implemented in Concurrency Monitoring.

With [API v2.0](http://docs.adobeptime.io/cm-api-v2/), if any of these attributes is required by the defined policies, a session init attempt without that attribute will result in a 400 Bad Request.

## Examples of using metadata attributes for creating policies {#examples-metadata-attr}

The standard metadata fields can be used for defining server-side policies based on their field values:

* You can configure a policy to only apply to specific field values (for example, a dedicated iOS policy: where `osType` is `iOS`)
* You can limit the number of distinct values for a given field. Some examples are as follows:
    * no more than X distinct devices: `HAVING DISTINCT COUNT(deviceId) <= 2`
    * no more than X distinct zipcodes: `HAVING DISTINCT COUNT(zipcode) <= 3`
* You can limit the number of active streams per field value. Some examples are as follows:
