# Getting Started with Concurrency Monitoring {#getting-started-overview}

Welcome to Concurrency Monitoring! This guide will help you understand the fundamentals and get your integration up and running quickly.

## The Problem Concurrency Monitoring Solves {#problem-solved}

In today's streaming landscape, subscribers expect to access content across multiple devices and applications. However, this creates challenges for content providers:

- **Content licensing agreements** often limit the number of simultaneous streams
- **Bandwidth costs** increase with excessive concurrent usage
- **User experience** suffers when too many streams degrade performance
- **Revenue protection** requires preventing account sharing abuse

Concurrency Monitoring provides a centralized solution to these challenges.


## How Concurrency Monitoring Works

### Core Functionality

Concurrency Monitoring operates as a **session management service** that:

1. **Tracks active streaming sessions** in real-time across all your applications
2. **Evaluates business policies** against current usage patterns
3. **Enforces limits** when policies are violated
4. **Provides resolution options** when conflicts occur

## Benefits for Different Stakeholders

### Content Providers (Programmers)

- **Protect content rights** and comply with licensing agreements
- **Optimize bandwidth costs** by preventing excessive usage
- **Improve user experience** with clear feedback on limits
- **Gain usage insights** through detailed reporting

### Identity Providers (MVPDs)

- **Enforce subscriber agreements** across all content partners
- **Centralized policy management** for multiple applications
- **Real-time monitoring** of usage patterns
- **Scalable architecture** handling millions of sessions

### End Users

- **Clear understanding** of their usage limits
- **Consistent experience** across all applications
- **Options to resolve conflicts** when limits are reached
- **Transparent feedback** on why access is restricted
